## What is this?

An unofficial fork of [2009scape/2009Scape-mobile](https://github.com/2009scape/2009Scape-mobile), which is itself an unofficial Android app for playing 2009Scape, built on PojavLauncher.

I built this for me. I wanted to play 2009Scape on my tablet, I found the existing app had been sitting untouched since 2024, and fixed the things that were stopping me enjoying it. It works well enough now that it seemed worth sharing.

I am not committing to maintaining it, supporting it, or taking requests. There is no roadmap and there are no promises. If it is useful to you, please use it and I hope you enjoy it too.

I used AI.

## Added

| | |
|---|---|
| Interface scale | The world renders at your device's full resolution while the interface is drawn larger, so nothing is soft and nothing is too small to tap. Slider in Settings. |
| View distance | Stock is 28 tiles, this defaults to 48 and goes to 103, the whole loaded map. Use `::vd #` in game, and `::vd fog` to turn the fog off. Both take effect straight away. |
| Up to date client | The client is rebuilt from source with two years of upstream desktop fixes merged in, including a sleep in the game loop, roof hiding and correct chat icons. |
| Drag with a finger | Scroll bars and inventory items can be dragged by finger. Before this only a pen could. |
| Camera controls | Pan sensitivity and invert Y, both in Control customization. |
| Camera smoothing | On by default and eased over 300ms. `::cs <ms>` changes it, 0 to 600, and `::cs 0` turns it off. |
| Pinch zoom | With its own sensitivity slider. |
| Keep running in the background | The game stays connected while you are in another app. Changable in Settings. |
| Optional system UI | Keeps the status bar and the navigation buttons on screen. Changable in Settings. |
| Nameplates | Craftify ships with the app. |
| Better keyboard integration | The on-screen keyboard covered game, now the game scales to fit. |
| Controller key bindings (HD) | In Settings → Control customization → Controller settings → Controller key bindings, choose a keyboard key for each button, trigger, D-pad direction, or directional stick input. Choices save automatically and apply after restarting the HD game. Each input can keep its default action or be unbound, and all bindings can be reset. See [controller bindings](docs/controller-bindings.md). |

## Fixed

| | |
|---|---|
| Touch accuracy | Now accurate and not offset slightly. If you run in any kind of windowed mode and resize, it'll need a restart. |
| Stylus / s-pen | The pen moved the cursor but never clicked. Now supports left and right click. |
| World map | It draws properly now, and pans by finger. Use two fingers up and down to zoom, pinch is unreliable. |
| Music | It doesn't stop any more, unless it would normally in game. |
| Sound effects and ambient | They now both play and don't cut out. |
| Background audio | The game kept playing with the app minimised or the screen off, not any more. |
| Camera controls | Improved gesture recognition for pan and pinch to zoom, and the judder is gone. |
| Two finger scrolling | A new scroll started from wherever the last one ended and flew off in the wrong direction. Sensitivity and inversion are in Control customization. |
| Launcher buttons | The HD and SD hitboxes did not line up with the artwork on most screens. |
| Header bar | Now positioned correctly |
| Settings | Previously no way out of the screen, and the back button crashed on sub-pages. |
| Updating the app | An update could not replace the parts of the game the app installs on first run, which is why the 3.0 audio fix never reached anyone. It can now. |

## Known and not fixed

Battery use might still be high.

## Install
